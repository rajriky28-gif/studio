/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the waitlist application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is designed for a pre-launch waitlist application. It allows unauthenticated (anonymous) users to add their email to the waitlist while preventing malicious actors from spamming the system.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All waitlist entries are stored in the top-level `/waitlistEntries/{waitlistEntryId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Writes with Validation: Anyone can create a waitlist entry, but the 'id' field must match the document ID, and the 'email' and 'timestamp' fields are required.
 * - No Listing: Listing waitlist entries is explicitly denied to prevent unauthorized data scraping.

    /**
     * @description Allows anyone to create a waitlist entry with a validated 'id', 'email', and 'timestamp'. Prevents listing or reading of waitlist entries.
     * @path /waitlistEntries/{waitlistEntryId}
     * @allow (create) - An unauthenticated user can create a waitlist entry with a valid email and the 'id' field matching the document ID.
     *   Example: `request.auth == null && request.resource.data.email == 'test@example.com' && request.resource.data.id == waitlistEntryId`
     * @deny (create) - An unauthenticated user cannot create a waitlist entry with a mismatched 'id' field.
     *   Example: `request.auth == null && request.resource.data.email == 'test@example.com' && request.resource.data.id != waitlistEntryId`
     * @deny (list) - No one can list waitlist entries.
     *   Example: Any request to list documents in the `waitlistEntries` collection.
     * @deny (get) - No one can read waitlist entries.
     *   Example: Any request to get a specific document in the `waitlistEntries` collection.
     * @deny (update) - No one can update waitlist entries.
     *   Example: Any request to update a document in the `waitlistEntries` collection.
     * @deny (delete) - No one can delete waitlist entries.
     *   Example: Any request to delete a document in the `waitlistEntries` collection.
     * @principle Allows public writes to the waitlist but restricts listing/reading and validates the email and ID.
