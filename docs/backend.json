    "reasoning": "Given the pre-launch nature focused on collecting emails for a waitlist, the Firestore structure is designed for simplicity and scalability. We prioritize ease of querying and future expansion. The primary focus is on the `waitlistEntries` collection. \n\n**Authorization Independence:** Since this is a pre-launch marketing site with no user authentication required besides anonymous users to avoid spam, we can directly write to the `waitlistEntries` collection without needing to denormalize any authorization data. The collection is publicly writeable but limited via Firestore Rules.\n\n**Structural Segregation:** All documents within `waitlistEntries` have the same security posture (publicly writeable with validation rules), so we avoid structural complexity.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** List operations on `waitlistEntries` are not required based on the current scope, but if they were needed in the future, simple queries based on `timestamp` or `referrer` would be possible due to the flat structure."
